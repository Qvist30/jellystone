## Synopsis
The Jellystone package contains models that can be used to model the what would happen to the polulations of the elk, coyote, and wolves if wolves were introduced to the park.

## Motivation
These are models for the Group 4 team of SYSEN 533 for PSU Spring 2017 semester. 

## Installation
You will need to have both MATLAB and SIMULINK to run these files.
If you have reasonable models (presently only Jellystone_v2 behaves appropriately), then you should be able to call wolfpop with the variables wolves, elk, and coyote after you have executed the simulation.  This should return the ideal initial wolf population.  

NOTE: I haven't yet included the fact that elk population is supposed to be at or below in 30 years, in actuality I don't believe any of our models fits the plans for getting elk and coyote populations to be at or below their current levels, while also making sure the coyote population decreases by no more than 50%, and the elk population decreases by no more than 30%.  At 13 wolves in year 0, the number of coyotes is just above 50% after year 30, and the elk population is just above 100%.
